# SEP Project description

<!-- TODO STARTS HERE -->

## Short description:

The goal of this project is to design and implement a PIC24F based sensor node
that can communicate with a PC workstation, allowing for data visualization and control via a GUI.

## Requirements

- The system must (...)
- Must use PIC24F microprocessor must be used for sensor node;
- Must obtain analog sensor data (via ADC);
- Must obtain data from a sensor via i^2C communication;
- 

## Features
